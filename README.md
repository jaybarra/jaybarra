# 👋 Hello, Bem Vindo, živjo  

## I'm a Software Developer

I love exploring **functional** and **concurrent** programming, and I’m passionate about **data science**.  
Most of my tinkering ends up on my personal website, where I try to blend technical rigor with thoughtful design to build useful, well‑crafted tools.
