## Hello, Bem Vindo, Zdravo ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer.

My interests lie in functional and concurrent programming, and I primarily work with Elixir, Clojure, and JavaScript.
Most of my tinkering ends up integrated into my [personal website](https://draconic-systems.com).

In all my endeavors, I strive to combine technical prowess with thoughtful design, aiming to make useful and well-built tools.
