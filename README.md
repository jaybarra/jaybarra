## Hello, Bem Vindo, Zdravo ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer.

My interests lie in functional and concurrent programming. Most of my tinkering ends up integrated into my [personal website](https://draconic-systems.com).

In all my endeavors, I strive to combine technical prowess with thoughtful design, aiming to make useful and well-built tools.

I enjoy most software languages
- Python
- Elixir
- Clojure
- JavaScript
- Java
- and have experience with many more
